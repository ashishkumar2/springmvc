To deploy a Spring WAR file in JBoss EAP (Enterprise Application Platform) and start the application, you can follow these general steps:

Prepare the WAR file: Ensure that your Spring application is packaged as a WAR (Web Archive) file. This WAR file should contain all necessary resources and dependencies.

Access JBoss EAP management console: Open a web browser and navigate to the JBoss EAP management console. The URL typically looks like this: http://localhost:9990/console.

Login to the management console: Enter your credentials to log in to the JBoss EAP management console. If you haven't changed the default credentials, you can use the default username and password (usually "admin"/"admin").

Deploy the WAR file: In the management console, navigate to the "Runtime" tab and then select "Deployments" from the menu on the left. Click on the "Add Content" button and upload your WAR file.

Enable the deployment: After uploading the WAR file, select the deployment and choose to enable it. This will make your application available for deployment.

Start the application: Once the deployment is enabled, select the deployment again if it's not already selected, and click the "Start" button to start the application.

Verify deployment: After starting the application, you should see it listed as "Started" in the deployments list. You can also verify that your application is running correctly by accessing its URL in a web browser.
